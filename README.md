# PRO_Example
Progressive Reconstruction of Off-diagonals (PRO) can be used to identify off-diagonals of the input and transmission matrices, which directly translates to recovery of spatially-varying point spread functions (PSFs). This example code demonstrates the implementation of PRO workflow on the provided example data.
